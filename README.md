# Statistical Modeling Project

## Objective
A comprehensive project focused on statistical modeling and inference using the Titanic dataset. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model building.

## Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
Ensure Python and required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) are installed. Set up a project directory and include the necessary datasets.

### 2. Data Cleaning Script
Refer to the `data_cleaning.py` file for the data cleaning script used in this project.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Refer to the `eda.py` file for the exploratory data analysis script used in this project.

### 4. Model Building
Refer to the `ml_model.py` file for the machine learning model building script used in this project.

## Results
### Data Cleaning
The cleaned dataset (`cleaned_train.csv`) is ready for further analysis and visualization.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed using various visualizations to understand the data trends and relationships. Key insights include:
- Age distribution of passengers
- Survival rate by passenger class

### Model Building
A RandomForestClassifier model was built and evaluated. The classification report and confusion matrix are included in the results.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model building, providing a comprehensive overview of statistical modeling and inference.
